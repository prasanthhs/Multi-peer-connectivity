# Multi-peer-connectivity

Uses ioS Multi Peer connectivity API of Xcode.
Currently its a simple chat application which can broadcast to up to 7 different people. However we need to manually add each user from each phone to form a broadcast circle.
Communication was OK through Bluetooth and WIFI

How to use:

Import project to Xcode and use. Run on Phone for actual results. Simulator may not work well with this as per apple documentation
